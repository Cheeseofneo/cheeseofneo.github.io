I am a researcher with a background in CS & EE, with a particular interest in AIGC. My current work focuses on exploring unified feature representations across modalities, efficient diffusion theory and PEFT of multimodal models.

I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a **Ph.D.** position and **Research Assistant** where I can contribute to projects in computer vision, machine learning, and related AI fields. I am highly motivated to collaborate with leading researchers and further advance my expertise in representation learning.
