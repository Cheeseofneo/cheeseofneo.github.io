Internship
============

- **Baidu, Beijing, China** — *AI Research Intern, Team Apollo*  
  *July 2024 – Oct 2024*  
  - For multisensor perception model, proposed an infrastructure of model fusion based on shared weights and backbone fusion. Also conducted a cross-training strategy for multi-object detection and utilized distillation to compensate accuracy.  
  - For BEV2Instance module in BEV perception model, conducted novel optimization on the self-attention and deformable attention modules based on precision descent and infrastructure compression, and proved efficiency in training accuracy.  

- **Momenta, Shenzhen, China** — *System Architecture Intern, Team Middleware of System*  
  *March 2023 – July 2023*  
  - Designed the timestamp synchronization architecture of the ADAS system, and constructed a simulated signal generator in the signal simulation platform, which involved validating signal pathways and creating abnormal signals.  
  - Developed a testbench-board verification platform based on SOMEIP for resource scheduling of hardware, ensuring signal accuracy and communication correctness in high-concurrency scenarios.  

Other Experience
============

- **ICM 2021, Finalist Award (Top 1%)**  
  *Jan 2020 – Mar 2020*  
  - Proposed PRE (Page-Rank Entropy) model vector network of musicians and quantified influence of musicians by node weights from time-span and genre-span perspectives.  
  - Constructed local and global similarity evaluation model based on cosine similarity of multi-dimensional eigenvectors extracted by PCA. Utilized k-means clustering to classify the significance of eigens between and within genres.  
  - Adopted sliding window automatic regression model as a time series forecasting method on main eigens to predict the long- and short-term development trends of musical genres.
