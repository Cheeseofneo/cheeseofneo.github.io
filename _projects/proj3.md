# excerpt: "Research on multisensor perception models and BEV2Instance optimization."
highlights:
  - Design an active autofocus microscope using linear array CCD whose accuracy at the nanometer level and speed at the millisecond level. Develop a focus calibration algorithm, which conducts weighted fusion to the results.
  - Propose a centroid extraction algorithm at sub-pixel level based on multiscale feature extraction, and fit linear mapping using sliding finite impulse response filter.
