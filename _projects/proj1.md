excerpt: "Research on multisensor perception models and BEV2Instance optimization."
highlights:
    - Accelerated the diffusion process by adopting an aggressive quantization scheme (W1A1) to minimize memory footprint, while simultaneously guiding the model to learn more generalizable image representations.
    - Investigated the role of prompts under different noise conditions in Bi-Directional Diffusion Models (BiDM). Designed experiments to decompose the latent noise space using PCA and SVD, enabling fine-grained redistribution of basic noise components and a clearer understanding of prompt–noise interaction.
    - Exploring whether the representation ability of LDMs correlates with  the perceptual quality of synthesized images. Employ masking-based learning strategies to assess how partial observation affects latent space representation and final image fidelity
