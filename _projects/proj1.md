excerpt: "Research on multisensor perception models and BEV2Instance optimization."
# highlights:
#   - Accelerate the diffusion process in two aspects:quantize the model parameters(W1A1)and make the model learn general representation of images to reduce the sample steps.
#   - Conducted a cross-training strategy for multi-object detection and utilized distillation to compensate accuracy.
#   - Optimized self-attention and deformable attention modules in BEV2Instance with precision descent and infra compression.
