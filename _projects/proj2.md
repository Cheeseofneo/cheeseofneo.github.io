# excerpt: "Research on multisensor perception models and BEV2Instance optimization."
highlights:
   - Proposed a novel framework for analyzing and mitigating quantization-induced reasoning errors in LLMs.
   - Introduced an automated error taxonomy (Conceptual, Method, Execution, Reasoning) and a compact “Silver Bullet” dataset enabling rapid recovery of math reasoning performance.
   - Achieved full-precision level accuracy restoration with only 332 samples and 3–5 minutes of training on a single GPU.
